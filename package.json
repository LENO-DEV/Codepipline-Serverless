  "description": "This directory contains sample AWS Proton Environment and Service templates to showcase how you can leverage AWS Proton Environments to create shared resources across multiple Services. The environment template contains a simple Amazon DynamoDB table and an S3 Bucket. Then there are two service templates. One service template creates a simple CRUD API service backed by Lambdas and an API gateway and includes an AWS Code Pipeline for continuos delivery. The second service template creates a data processing service that consumes data from an API, pushes that data into a kinesis stream which is then subsequently consumed by another Lambda and then pushes that data into a firehose that ends up in the S3 Bucket configured by the environment template, again offering continuous delivery via AWS CodePipeline.",
